I'm sharing some more info about how the site was created and how i've modified from the original theme.  

---

This site is powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The theme is [no-style-please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please). For a run through of what some typical markdown features look like in this theme, look [here](https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/overview-post.html).

## Modifications
I have added some personal options that I'll run through below:
### Images
(Images are naturally centered in this theme, check the stylesheet `_sass/no-style-please.scss`)Native Markdown has the following command to display an image:
```
![alt text](image.jph)
```
resulting in: <br>
![messi5](/assets/images/messi5.jpg)
<br>
To add a caption, center the image and caption, and include an optional URL: create `image.html` in the `_inludes` directory with the following content:

{% raw %}
```
<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper" >
    {% if include.url %}
    <a href="{{ include.url }}" title="{{ include.title }}" target="_blank">
    {% endif %}
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/{{ include.img }}" alt="{{ include.title }}"/>
    {% if include.url %}
    </a>
    {% endif %}
    {% if include.caption %}
        <p class="image-caption">{{ include.caption }}</p>
    {% endif %}
</div>
```
{% endraw %}

Now we can use jekyll layout syntaxing to input an image with the following options:
- img: path to the image
- title: alt text
- url: (optional) url the image will point to
- caption: (optional) caption that will be displayed under the image

In a css file add the following:
```

.image-wrapper {
   text-align: center;
}
 .image-wrapper .image-caption {
   color: #919191;
   margin-top: 1.5;
}

```
Now to insert an image issue the following:
```
{% raw %}
{% include image.html
            img="assets/images/messi5.jpg"
            title="Messi"
            caption="This is Messi5" %}
{% endraw %}
```
{% include image.html
            img="assets/images/messi5.jpg"
            title="Messi"
            caption="This is Messi5" %}

### Writing Math
[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) is a JavaScript engine for mathematics that works in all browsers. It allows for an extension to vanilla markdown's interpretation of LaTeX style mathematics syntax. I primarily just wanted the capability to have numbered equations, but MathJax comes with more capabilities.
To enable MathJax, add the following to a file in `_includes/head.html`:
{% raw %}
```
{% if page.usemathjax %}
  <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({
    TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: "AMS" } }
    });
  </script>
  <script type="text/javascript" async src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

Then enable *MathJax* in the header section of your markdown document with *jekyll* syntaxing:
`usemathjax: true`.

Then write an equation 
\$$
\begin{equation}
a + b = c \label{eq:one}
\end{equation} 
$$

with: 

{% raw %}
```
\$$
\begin{equation}
a + b = c \label{eq:one}
\end{equation} 
$$
```
{% endraw %}
Adding the `label` tag will create an anchor, which can be used with `\eqref{eq:one}` - Equation \eqref{eq:one}.
