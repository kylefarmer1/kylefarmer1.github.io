Hello, I'm Kyle Farmer, a second year [master's](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/materials/graduate/master-of-science-programs/master-of-science-in-computational-materials-science-cmse/index.html) student in **Carnegie Mellon University's** department of Materials Science & Engineering in Pittsburgh, PA. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Elizabeth Holm](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/materials/people/faculty/bios/holm.html). I am also a computational materials scientist for Honeywell FM&T.

Previously, I received my B.S. at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, majoring in Chemical Engineering where I was a part of the [Energy Institute of Louisiana](https://energy.louisiana.edu/). Geaux Cajuns!

My **research** focuses on how we can leverage powerful machine learning models in a materials science and manufacturing environment to improve production efficiency and accelerate material discovery. I am particularly interested in improving qualitative analysis of material micrographs with state-of-the-art computer vision models. My current project is automating size and shape analysis of powder feedstock images using instance segmentation output.

In my **free time** I enjoy watching soccer and learning how to cook. I mainly keep up with the Premier League (England), La Liga (Spain), the Champions League (Europe), and any international games (World Cup/Euros/etc). Most of my cooking inspiriation comes from content produced by [J. Kenji Lopez Alt](http://www.kenjilopezalt.com/). I find his approach to content creation is the perfect balance of science, practicality, thoroughness, beginner-friendly, and deliciosness!
