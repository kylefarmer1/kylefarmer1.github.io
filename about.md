Hello, I'm Kyle Farmer, a second year [master's](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/materials/graduate/master-of-science-programs/master-of-science-in-computational-materials-science-cmse/index.html) student in **Carnegie Mellon University's** department of Materials Science & Engineering in Pittsburgh, PA. I am advised by Professor [Elizabeth Holm](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/materials/people/faculty/bios/holm.html). I am also a computational materials scientist for Honeywell FM&T.

Previously, I received my B.S. at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, majoring in Chemical Engineering where I was a part of the [Energy Institute](https://energy.louisiana.edu/).

My research focuses on how we can leverage powerful machine learning models in a materials science and manufacturing environment to improve production efficiency and accelerate material discovery. I am interested in improving qualitative analysis of material micrographs with state of the art computer vision models. My current project is automating size and shape analysis of powder feedstock images using instance segmentation output.
